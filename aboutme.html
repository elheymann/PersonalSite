        <h3>Career Story</h3>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp As a child, I was always fascinated with computers. My most memorable moment was when I was in
            middle school in the 90s. I had the opportunity to learn a programming language called Logo where I moved a turtle to draw
            geometric shapes.  It was like a puzzle to me and I loved the sense of fulfillment with solving it. From
            then on, I was always working with computers or helping someone work on computer projects or technical issues. In
            college, I was exposed to a few coding challenges and wanted to pursue a degree in IT. After 9/11, I kept
            feeling a sense of obligation to serve my country as many of my family members did before me and gain IT
            experience while doing so. Although it opened many doors when I became a government contractor, I did not
            like the atmosphere I was in. So I decided to step away and became a stay at home mom with my young children
            while attaining my MBA. I missed being in the technical world, but I did not want to continue down the same path.
            I wanted to go back to what I enjoyed - coding. I contemplated a few coding schools, and finally chose Codeup.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbspThe atmosphere is friendlier and welcoming than what I have been accustomed to, and with my
            personality I definitely enjoy it. I love how there are so many things to learn and that we can challenge ourselves to
            find innovative ways to accomplish the same task. After Codeup, I want to gain experience in the field by finding
            a web development position while continuing to learn more about new technologies and/or languages to expand my
            knowledge. My “end goal”, after I have a few years of coding in the workplace under my belt, would be to
            continue coding. Much like the calling I had to serve my country, one day I hope to be an advocate for women
            in technology.
